# MatplotlibFigureMerge
**Merge** figures matplotlib generated, and **remove the white border** around the figures.<br>
***
### The reason for writing this project
Since there are white edges around the image generated by matplotlib, 
the image will appear small when placing the image in the paper. 
When splicing multiple images, you need to remove the white edges and merge them.
